# Changelog

This is the changelog for Minigame Madness.  All noteworthy changes to the game
will be documented in this file.

This changelog follows the
[Keep a Changelog version 1.0.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
convention.  
Minigame Madness _does not_ use Semantic Versioning.


## [0.13] - 2022-04-06

### Added

- The version number label on the main menu will now display the version number
  for the version of the Godot Engine that was used to build Minigame Madness.

- New minigame: Dance, Dance, Dance!

- A SConstruct profile used to compile an optimal version of the Godot Engine
  for Minigame Madness exports is now available in custom.py.

### Changed

- Minigames in the Debug menu are now listed by title rather than number.

### Deprecated

- The version number "types," i.e. "Pre-Release," "Alpha," and "Beta" have been
  deprecated.  For the time being, Minigame Madness will now simply use its own
  version number without additional unnecessary fluff.
